## Loading and preprocessing the data

  Read the data and convert the date column to a date type and the inverval column
to a factor type.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", nrows = 17568)
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date)
activity$interval <- as.factor(activity$interval)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r, echo=TRUE}
total_steps <- tapply(activity$steps,activity$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(total_steps)

mean_steps <- tapply(activity$steps,activity$date, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps <- tapply(activity$steps,activity$date, median, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_steps
median_steps
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
